# Gaia-Enceladus merge



## Instructions to use

1. Clone the repository in your computer and in the same folder put the archives of GALAH Survey. 
2. Execute the DataProcessing.ipynb notebook to crossmatch the tables and subselect the giants data
> If the archives are in another folder remember to modify the route
3. If everything works fine there will be new csv tables: giants.csv, solarveci.csv and complete.csv in the same folder. Those are the main sources of data that this project will use
### Remember that this is an under construction site and some codes will change
